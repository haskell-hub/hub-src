DESCRIPTION
-----------

The hub tool (i) integrates multiple releases of the Glasgow
Haskell Compiler into a single installation with a simple
mechanism for selecting between the installations and (ii)
provides a sandbox mechanism, allowing users to install
packages on a per-project basis.

The tool organizes compilation contexts around so-called "hubs"
which contain their own GHC package databases. A global hub
is shared among all users on the system and is typically installed
with the system package utility (e.g., 'yum' or 'apt') from
a public repository. Each global hubs is associated with a
single global package database.

User hubs belong to individual users, point at a global hub and
own a user package database into which the user can install packages
with 'cabal' and 'ghc'.

A directory will typically be statically associated with a hub.
Invoking 'cabal' and 'ghc within such a directory (or any of its
sub-directories) will select the appropriate version of GHC
(as determined by the hub configuration) and will set up the
tools to work with package database that is private to that
hub.

This is perhaps best illustrated by a sample session:
-----
    hub init -n 7.0.4       # create new hub based on GHC-7.0.4
                            # and associate the current directory with it
    cabal install SHA       # install the latest version of the SHA package
                            # in the user package database of the hub
    ghci crypto.hs          # load crypto.hs into 'ghci', which may make use of
                            # the GHC-7.0.4 core packages and the SHA
                            # package and any of its dependent packages.
-----
(This assumes GHC-7.0.4 is already installed; if not it may need to be
installed first with, for example 'yum install ghc-7.0.4-hub'.)

Each hub is named. We didn't specify a name for the new hub in the above
example so a new unused name like '__h006' will have been chosen. It could
be renamed to something more distinctive and then associated with another work
tree.
-----
    hub mv __h006 crypto    # rename hub to something more memorable
    hub set crypto          # remember to re-associate the current directory
                            # with the newly-named hub
    cd ~/digest             # switch to another work tree
    hub set crypto          # associate it with the crypto hub
-----
Now both work trees will be associated with the 'crypto' hub and any changes
made to it -- adding or removing packages -- will be reflected in the GHC
compilation context of both work trees.
   
To list all of the hub available to a user use
-----
    hub ls
-----
The listing won't include any hubs with names that start with '__'. To see
these in the listing use.
-----
    hub ls -a
-----

To find out more about an individual hub use
-----
    hub info crypto
-----

Note that global hub names start with a digit (e.g., '7.0.4',
'2011.4.0.0') and user hub names start with a letter or underscore
(e.g., 'crypto', '__h006').

As well as the directory context, the 'HUB' environment variable can
be used to select the context for Haskell toolkit command. E.g.,
-----
      HUB=2011.2.0.1 ghc-pkg list
-----
If the HUB environment variable is set it will always take precedence over
any directory settings.

To copy, rename, remove, swap, (un)lock, save, verify or load
a hub then use the 'hub cp', 'hub mv', 'hub rm', 'hub swap',
'hub lock', 'hub unlock', 'hub save', 'hub verify' or 'hub load',
respectively (see below).

If you have acquired the hub tool by installing the hub package
everything should be set up for you. Otherwise, you will have to
install the hub binary on your execution path under its own name ('hub')
and under the name of each of the standard GHC tools ('ghc', 'ghci',
'ghc-pkg', etc., and 'cabal') you want it to manage. (This is usually
managed by installing the hub program into a directory (like `/usr/hs/bin`)
and creating links from 'ghc', 'ghci', 'ghc-pkg', 'cabal', etc. to the
'hub' program.)      

To add a new global hub you will have to install an xml file in
`/usr/hs/hub (see hub(5) for details of the format of this file). Each
global hub configuration must specify where the compiler tools
are located.


COMMANDS
--------


`hub usage`::

     Lists the syntax of all the hub commands.


`hub help    [<hub-command>]`::

     Lists the help for a command or all commands if none
     specified. See "hub usage" for a command-syntax summary.


`hub version`::

     Lists the version information.


`hub default [<g-hub>|-]`::

     (Needs to be run as root.) If no arguments are given then this
     command lists the the default global hub for the system (i.e.,
     the default global hub used to set up each user's 'home' hub). If
     a global hub <g-hub> is specified then <g-hub> will become the
     default global hub. If a '-' is specified then any older default
     settings are discarded and the system default re-established.


`hub ls [-a] [-q]`::

     List the user hubs belonging to the logged in user and all of the
     global hubs. If -a is specified then all hubs are listed, otherwise
     the hidden hub (those starting with "__") are ommitted. Normally the
     locked status and any comments associated with the hub are displayed,
     but these will be ommitted if the -q flag is given.


`hub set     [<hub>|-]`::

     Set the 'current' hub for a directory and its sub-directories.
     The HUB environment variable can be set to a hub name to override
     this setting.


`hub info    [<hub>]`::

     Describe a hub. (See 'hub set' on how to set the current hub.)


`hub lock           [<hub>]`::

     Lock a hub so that it can not be removed or renamed or have packages
     added or removed.


`hub unlock         [<hub>]`::

     Remove the lock from a hub (see `hub lock` above).


`hub name`::

     List the name of the current hub. (See 'hub set' on how to set
     the current hub.)


`hub path    [<hub>]`::

     List the path of the XML file defining the named or current
     hub.


`hub xml     [<hub>]`::

     List the contents of the XML file defining the named or current
     hub.


`hub init [-n       [<hub>]]`::

     (See also 'hub init [-s]' below.) Create a new user hub with some
     unique name __h<num> and associates the current working directory with
     the new hub. If a hub is specified then that determines the global
     hub for the new hub otherwise the current default hub is used.


`hub init [-s]      [<hub>]   <u-hub'>`::

     (See also 'hub init -n' above.) Create the new named user hub <u-hub'>.
     If <hub> is specified then the global hub for the new hub is determined by
     this hub otherwise the default hub is used. Iff -s is specified
     the hub associated with the current directory is set to the new hub.


`hub cp      [<u-hub>] <u-hub'>`::

     Duplicate <u-hub> (or the current hub) in
     <u-hub'>. (See 'hub set' on how to set the current hub.)


`hub mv      [<u-hub>] <u-hub'>`::

     Renames user hub <u-hub> (or the current hub) to <u-hub'>. (See
     'hub set' on how to set the current hub.)


`hub rm       <u-hub>`::

     Deletes user hub <hub>.


`hub swap    [<u-hub>] <u-hub'>`::

     Swaps the contents of user hub <u-hub> (or the current hub) with
     user hub <u-hub'>.


`hub list    [<hub>]`::

      List the packages belonging to a hub (calls 'ghc-pkg list').


`hub check   [<hub>]`::

      Check the packages belonging to a hub are coherent 
      (calls 'ghc-pkg check').


`hub install    <pkg-name>`... ::

      Equivalent to: hub install-into ^ <pkg-name> ...


`hub install-into <u-hub> <pkg-name>`... ::

      Uses 'cabal install' to install the named packages into the named
      hub (or the current hub). (See 'hub set' on how to set the current hub.)


`hub erase      <pkg-name>`... ::

      Equivalent to: hub erase-from ^  <pkg-name> ...


`hub erase-from <u-hub> <pkg-name>`...::

      Determine all of the packages dependent on the list of named packaqes
      in the hub, lists them and offers to remove them from the hub (by
      invoking 'ghc-pkg unregister'). (See 'hub set' on how to set the
      current hub.)


`hub gc`::

      Run the garbage collector on the user hubs to reclaim library code
      that is no longer referenced by them. (The directories aren't removed
      from the file system, but moved from `~/.hubrc/heap` to
      `~/.hubrc/garbage` for manual removal.)

`hub save           [<u-hub>]`::

      Save out the configuration of the hub onto standard output.
      (See 'hub set' on how to set the current hub.)


`hub load           [<u-hub>]`::

      Load the hub from standard input. (i) If the named hub doesn't
      exist then the hub is created with the global hub specified by the
      archive; but If <u-hub> does exist then it is checked that it is using
      the global hub specified and if necessary removed and recreated
      referencing the right global hub. (ii) Any surplus packages not
      mentioned in the archive are then removed. (iii) Finally any packages
      missing from the hub listed in the archive are installed with
      `cabal-install`.


`hub verify [-s]    [<u-hub>]`::

      Check that the named hub (or the default hub) uses the global hub
      specified in the archive and that it contains all of the packages
      at the versions specified by the archive. If -s is specified
      then check that the hub contains no packages other than those specified
      by the archive.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------

`HUB`::

	This environment variable determines the hub that the hub
	wrapper will use while invoking a compiler tool. If it is not
	set then the .hub file (set by `hub set`) in the current
	directory or one its parent directories is used to determine
	the 'current' hub. If no parent directory defines the current
	hub then the default global hub is used (see the `hub default`
	command). The `HUB` environment variable overrides all of
	these so it is best left unset in interactive sessions unless
	you really want to force a single hub to be used regardless of
	work tree configuration.


FILES
-----

`.hub`::

	Lists the name of the hub for the current directory
	and it's subdirectories.

`~/.hubrc/hub/<u-hub>.xml`::

	Contains the hub-spefification file for user hub <u-hub>.

`~/.hubrc/lib/<u-hub>/package.config`::

	Contains the package database for user hub <u-hub>.

`~/.hubrc/heap`::

    Contains directories containing the library files for the
    packages installed in the user hubs.

`~/.hubrc/garbage`::

    Contains directories removed from `~/.hubrc/heap` by the garbage collector.

`/usr/hs/bin`::
	The standard location for the 'hub' program and the rest of
	the Haskell tools (as links to the 'hub' program) -- this directory
	should be put on the PATH if the tools aren't installed in /usr/bin.

`/usr/hs/hub/<g-hub>.xml`::

    XML configuration file for global hub <g-hub>.

`/usr/hs/db`::

	Standard location for the package databases for system hubs.

`/usr/hs/ghc/<version>`::

	Standard location for GHC <version> installation.

`/usr/hs/hp/<version>`::

	Standard installation locations for Haskell Platform <version>.


SEE ALSO
--------

	Describes the format of the XML configuration files used to
	configure the user and global hubs.
